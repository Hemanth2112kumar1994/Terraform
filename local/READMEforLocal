Terraform AWS Infrastructure

Overview

This repository contains Terraform configurations for provisioning AWS infrastructure. The projects in this repository demonstrate the use of local variables, input variables, and output variables to create scalable and reusable infrastructure components.

Features

Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Automate AWS resource provisioning using Terraform.

Modular Configuration: Uses variables for flexibility and reusability.

Best Practices: Implements Terraform best practices for maintainability and efficiency.

Getting Started

Prerequisites

Install Terraform

Configure AWS credentials using AWS CLI:

aws configure

Deployment Steps

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo

terraform init

Validate the configuration:

terraform validate

Plan the deployment:

terraform plan

Apply the configuration:

terraform apply -auto-approve

Destroy the infrastructure (if needed):

terraform destroy -auto-approve

Variables Explained

Local Variables (locals.tf): Used for simplifying complex expressions and improving readability.

Input Variables (variables.tf): Allow customization without modifying the source code.

Output Variables (outputs.tf): Provide important information about created resources.
